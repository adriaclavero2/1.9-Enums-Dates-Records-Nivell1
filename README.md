Task 9

Description

Learning project in Java to explore three fundamental features that help write clearer, safer, and more modern code:
Enums to represent finite and controlled values.
The goal is to understand how these features improve readability, enforce type safety, and reduce errors compared to traditional approaches.

📌 Exercise Statement

— Enums

Enums (enumerations) allow defining a set of constant values, giving meaningful names and improving code safety. They are useful to represent closed options such as days of the week, priority levels, or entity states. Unlike String or int, enums prevent invalid values and can include behavior (methods).

✨ Features

Demonstration of enums for type-safe constant values.
Use of Java Time API for robust date and time manipulation.
Application of records to reduce boilerplate and enforce immutability.
Comparison between modern practices (enums, records, Java Time) and traditional imperative coding with strings, mutable classes, or legacy date APIs.

🛠 Technologies

Java 14 or higher (records are available from Java 14 onwards).
IntelliJ IDEA or any compatible IDE.

🚀 Installation and Execution

Clone the repository.
Compile and run in IntelliJ IDEA or another IDE.
Execute the different main() methods for each exercise.
Observe how enums, Java Time, and records simplify code compared to traditional approaches.

🧩 Diagrams and justification of technical decisions

Enums: show how they encapsulate both values and behavior.
